### Parva App - Complete User Guide

## 🪷 Understanding the System

### The Sacred Structure

The Parva system is built on the power of **7** - a number representing completeness and cycles in many traditions.

**343 Days = 7 × 7 × 7**

#### Level 1: Maha-Parva (343 days)
The grand journey. Nearly a year of dedicated practice.

#### Level 2: Parva (49 days each, 7 total)
Each Parva has one of seven themes:
1. **Beginning** (Violet) - Laying the foundation
2. **Practice** (Indigo) - Building through repetition
3. **Discernment** (Blue) - Developing clarity
4. **Ascent** (Green) - Accelerating growth
5. **Mastery** (Yellow) - Solidifying skills
6. **Flow** (Orange) - Finding rhythm
7. **Renewal** (Red) - Integration and rest

#### Level 3: Saptaha (7 days each, 7 per Parva)
A Saptaha is a "week" that also follows the same 7 themes.

Within the "Beginning" Parva, you'll have:
- Saptaha 1: Beginning within Beginning
- Saptaha 2: Practice within Beginning
- Saptaha 3: Discernment within Beginning
- ...and so on

This creates a beautiful fractal pattern!

#### Level 4: Dina (1 day, 7 per Saptaha)
Each day has its own micro-theme:
1. **Initiate** - Start fresh
2. **Stabilize** - Build consistency
3. **Observe** - Notice patterns
4. **Strengthen** - Push through
5. **Expand** - Go further
6. **Integrate** - Connect the dots
7. **Reflect** - Look back and learn

These themes repeat every 7 days throughout the entire 343-day cycle.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Daily Ritual
Make checking your Dina part of your morning or evening routine.

### 2. Write Something Every Day
Even a single sentence. It's powerful to look back months later.

### 3. Use the Themes as Prompts
If stuck, reflect on:
- How did today's Dina theme show up?
- How does the current Saptaha theme feel?
- What's the Parva teaching me?

### 4. Review Weekly
Every Saptaha 7 (Reflect), read your week's notes.

### 5. Celebrate Transitions
When moving to a new Parva, acknowledge the shift in energy.

### 6. Be Gentle with Gaps
Missed days? That's okay. Pick up where you are, not where you "should" be.

The Parva system honors:
- **Cyclical time** over linear time
- **Process** over outcome
- **Rhythm** over rigidity
- **Reflection** over perfection

Each day is a point in a larger pattern. Trust the cycle.
